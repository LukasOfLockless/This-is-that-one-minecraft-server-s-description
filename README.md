# This is that one minecraft server's description
 so this is all about my server and how im ruining the standart minecraft experience

its just hardmode 0 spawn protection natural regeneration world border far pregenerated chunks
im using spigot-api and eclipse as an ide. server running on paper. got pregenerated 10k overworld. 

helloworld:
description: says hello to the world. make proxychat limits next.

heal healself
description: heal yourself  or smbd close or smbd u're looking at. there is a requirement. you need to have used the brewing stand a few times.

eatdirt eatsand:
description: look at a dirt block and type /eatdirt to eat dirt or /eatsand to eatsand. it will take away your EGO. you have to have advanced experience on breaking blocks. 

tellmemore: tells more
amiworthy: evaluates your efforts. admin might actually take a look at your stats if you call this. if you are worthy then you gon get an unlock in some features of the server.
note: unfinished, i will come back to it before the snow completely melts in the Pidgeon country.

stopped watching tutorials and began reading api documentation

usage: /blockrace <start,yes,ready,score,cancel,ruleset,help,set<rules,blocksperrace,minutesperblock,prep>,xp,rejoin>
blockrace start: spams chat to get players involved in blockrace. auto involves the one who starts it
blockrace yes:
blockrace ready: remmembers location and the amount of exp the player has
blockrace score: messages you the latest score on the race
blockrace cancel: op command to kill the race.
blockrace set rules: sets a ruleset for blockrace. just plain text
blockrace help: gives racers critical info
blockrace set blocksperrace <amount of blocks to find>: set how many rounds there are. every round has a bigger chance to be ridiculously hard blocks as the goal
blockrace set minutesperblock <minutes to death>: set how long before a player loses
blockrace set preptime <seconds of preptime>:  it's a short period <seconds> for players in the server to do /blockraceyes and join the race
blockrace rejoin: a small helping hand, when a player disconnects for any reason while racing and relogs while the race is still going on. 
blockracetesttp: test a tp function. is it safe, how does it break?
blockracetestdetection: looks for a very specific block and then craches the server, pls fix this shit

name: killOP
description: welcome to blocknarchy, blockplucker
killop: kills every online op and deops them on the server
	
name: logdeath
description:  logs player deaths for bugs and "pls give me back my shit" purposes. i do write many bugs that kill lately. ill get in touch with you if you died because of my fault. dont beg.

anyway. heres some plugin names, since my braincells got rubbed against eachother and got angry.
Plugins (17): BlockRace, celebrate, deathnote, demondragonkings, eat, FastChunkPregenerator, fuckingexpensiveenchantments, heal, helloworld, killOP, ProtocolLib, PvpExp, RandomRespawnsanddrugs, Sleep, ViaBackwards, ViaVersion, xp 
oh and current map seed is 8666420691339 and I encourage you to scourge https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/

ummm... so anyway.
/home /warp is easy and smells like p2w servers. /tavern is cool. i had this idea for before i even started coding them plugins. remember the good old days when using your hearthstone would get you back to you questig party? 
so the concept is that you have to build a tavern and the make some tevernblocks and then anyone who uses a tavern block would return to your tavern. with a 60 minute and 30 second cast time, moving would break the cast and set the cooldown.as well as a quick check to see if the tavern wasnt destroyed. i think it all centers around the CAMPFIRE or smt like that. 

creeper griefing is annoying and frustrating? if you answer yes to that question I am judging you on a personal level. what do you do when life gives you lemons? 
/killquest is an idea that you can kill all the hostile mobs in a chunk. the reward is a use of some cool command to add a description to some item as well a permantent and irreversable change in hostile mobs spawning there. imma go ahead and list them : creeper, zombies, skeletons, spider. slaughter like a stack for each type. or an omega 1024 stack of all combined. quest complete. all participants get a reward.

PIDGEON SERVER AND NO PIDGEON PLUGIN?!?!?!
k.


why haven't i done it yet? time is a limited resource and i like to nap.
