i really like to see loads of explosions. it's just one of those things.
i like the ambient war sounds in the distance
i like when players flex using wither names as if withers are immortal
i like wars and the drama it reeks of
i like seeing lavacasts and a chunk that has been deleted down to obsidian
seeing mf fly in boats
love lagg or rage and quit
looking for friends is as hard as it gets.
i love something about the death of a hardcore world. but what is it. am i charmed?
