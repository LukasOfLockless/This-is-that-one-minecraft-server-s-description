i really like to see loads of explosions. it's just one of those things.

i like the ambient war sounds in the distance

i like when players flex using wither names as if withers are immortal

i like wars and the drama it reeks of love lagg or rage inducing drama

i like seeing lavacasts and a chunk that has been deleted down to obsidian

seeing mf fly in boats

looking for friends is as hard as it gets with random spawn.

i love something about the death of a hardcore world. but what is it. am i charmed?

and when standart compass goes brrrt NORTH
 
really need to start making these work instead of /quiest , killquest tavern or enchantments or unabusable villagers or lore
