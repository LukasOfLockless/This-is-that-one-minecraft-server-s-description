i really like to see loads of explosions. it's just one of those things. + paper server settings

i like when players flex using wither names as if withers are immortal - diy

i like wars and the drama it reeks of - natural path of server growth. people = monkeys. monkeys=war

i love lagg pvp - needs players,but can we make server lag artificially? i wanna play in alaggy server, seems fun

i like seeing lavacasts and a chunk that has been deleted down to obsidian - diy

seeing mf fly in boats -diy

looking for friends is as hard as it gets with random spawn. +

i love something about the death of a hardcore world. but what is it. am i charmed? +

when standart compass goes brrrt NORTH +
 
really need to start making these work instead of killquest is stupid and basic. but its by players , for players. +

when enchantments mean you are cool, liek they expensive af
